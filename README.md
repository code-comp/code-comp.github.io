## Features

Code Comp is a website that allows users to compete against each other in a variety of coding challenges. Players can create their own challenges, or compete in challenges created by other users. The challenges are graded automatically, and the results are displayed on the leaderboard. The leaderboard is sorted by the number of points a user has earned. The points are earned by completing challenges, and the number of points earned is determined by the difficulty of the challenge.
